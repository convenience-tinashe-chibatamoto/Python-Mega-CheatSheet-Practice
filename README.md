# Python Interview Prep: Q and Ans:

1. What is Python?<br>
Ans: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
 * High-level: A high-level language is a programming language that is designed to be human-readable and abstracts away the low-level details of computer hardware. This means that the code you write in Python is closer to natural language and easier for humans to understand, rather than being closer to the machine-level language (binary code) that the computer can directly execute.
 * Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line by a program called the interpreter. This is different from compiled languages where the entire code is converted into machine code before running. Interpretation allows for faster development cycles as you can test and make changes quickly without recompiling everything.

2. Why Python?<br>
Ans:
* Simplicity and Readability(clean, intuitive syntax),
* Versatility (Python is a multi-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, automation, and more),
* Large and Active Community (Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. This makes it easy to find solutions to common problems and get support.),
* Cross-platform Compatibility (Python is a cross-platform language, meaning it can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without the need for major changes to the code.),
* Rapid Prototyping(Since it's interpreted, this allows for faster development cycles as you can test and make changes quickly without recompiling everything.)

3. What are the key features of Python?<br>
Ans:
* Object-oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming concepts like classes and objects, enabling you to structure your code in a modular way.
* Portable: Python code can run on different operating systems without modification.
* Large third-party library ecosystem: There's a vast collection of external libraries available for various purposes, like data science (NumPy, Pandas), machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch), web development (Django, Flask), and more.
* Free and open-source: Python is free to use and modify, with a large and active community that contributes to its development.
* Dynamically typed: You don't need to declare variable types beforehand, making the code more flexible.

4. What is PEP 8?<br>
Ans:
* PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is the official style guide for Python code. It provides guidelines and best practices for writing clean, consistent, and readable Python code.
* This covers Naming Conventions for functions, variables, classes, etc (capital letters for constants, etc), Code Formatting (Line length should be limited to 79 characters (or 72 characters for docstrings and comments), Indentation should use 4 spaces per indentation level (no tabs), Blank lines should be used to separate logical sections of code. Imports should be placed at the top of the file, and should be organized into sections (standard library, third-party, local).
* There are many tools available to help you write PEP 8 compliant code. e.g. PyCharm.  These tools can check the code and automatically format it according to the PEP 8 guidelines.
* The code would still work the same way, but the style guide helps attain consistency across all Python development.
 

5. What are the differences between lists and tuples in Python?<br>
Ans: The main differences between lists and tuples in Python are:<br>
* Mutability:<br>
Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their contents after they are created. You can add, remove, or change elements in a list.
Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot modify their contents after they are created. Once a tuple is defined, its elements cannot be changed.
* Syntax:<br>
Lists are defined using square brackets [], and their elements are separated by commas.
Tuples are defined using parentheses (), and their elements are also separated by commas.
* Usage:<br>
Lists are generally used when you need to store a collection of items that may need to be modified later.
Tuples are often used to represent a fixed set of values, such as the coordinates of a point or the fields in a database record.
