Ans: In Python dictionaries, shallow copy and deep copy refer to how the contents of a dictionary are duplicated: <br>

Shallow Copy:
* Uses the built-in ```dict.copy()``` method.
* Any changes made to the values (objects) in the original dictionary will also be reflected in the shallow copy, and vice versa.<br>
Code Example:

```python
original_dict = {'a': [1, 2], 'b': 3}
shallow_copy = original_dict.copy()

# Modifying a mutable element in the shallow copy
shallow_copy['a'].append(3)

print("Original dictionary:", original_dict)  # Output: {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': 3}
print("Shallow copy:", shallow_copy)  # Output: {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': 3}
```

Deep Copy:
* Uses the ```copy.deepcopy()``` function from the ```copy``` module.
* A deep copy creates a new object with a completely independent copy of the data.
* Changes made to the values in the original dictionary or the deep copy won't affect each other. <br>
Code Example:
```python
import copy

original_dict = {'a': [1, 2], 'b': 3}
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_dict)

# Modifying a mutable element in the deep copy
deep_copy['a'].append(3)

print("Original dictionary:", original_dict)  # Output: {'a': [1, 2], 'b': 3}
print("Deep copy:", deep_copy)  # Output: {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': 3}
```
Usage:
* Use a shallow copy when you only need a new reference to the existing data and modifications in one will affect the other. (e.g., temporary modifications)
* Use a deep copy when you need to ensure that changes made to the copy do not affect the original (e.g., passing data to functions that might modify it)

72. How do you convert a string to an integer or a float in Python?<br>
Ans: You can convert a string to an integer or a float in Python using built-in functions: ```int(string)``` and ```float(string)```.<br>
Code Example:
```python
# String to integer
str_to_int = "42"
int_value = int(str_to_int)
print(int_value)  # Output: 42

# String to float
str_to_float = "3.14"
float_value = float(str_to_float)
print(float_value)  # Output: 3.14

# If the string cannot be converted to an integer, the int() function will raise a ValueError exception.
str_num = "123.45"

# Convert to integer (raises ValueError for non-integers)
# int_num = int(str_num)  # Uncomment to see the ValueError

# Also, if the string contains non-numeric characters, the conversion will fail and raise a ValueError.
str_with_non_numeric = "42.3.14"
float_value = float(str_with_non_numeric)
# ValueError: could not convert string to float: '42.3.14'
```

Note:
*You can also convert strings that represent numeric values with leading or trailing whitespace, as the ```int()``` and ```float()``` functions will automatically strip the whitespace.<br>
Code Example:
```python
str_with_whitespace = "  -10  "
int_value = int(str_with_whitespace)
print(int_value)  # Output: -10
```

* For something like ```'42.3.14'```, you may need to use additional string manipulation techniques, such as regular expressions, to extract the numeric part of the string before converting it to an integer or float.
