36.  What is the purpose of the ＿init＿ py file in Python packages?
Ans: The ```__init__.py``` file in Python serves two main purposes for Python packages:
* Marks a directory as a package:  A directory containing an ```__init__.py``` file is recognized by Python as a package. This allows you to organize your code into modules and sub-packages within the directory structure.
* Without ```__init__.py```, Python wouldn't treat the directory as a package and wouldn't be able to find modules within it.
* In essence, the ```__init__.py``` file acts like an entry point for your Python package, defining its structure and potentially initializing its behavior(optional).
