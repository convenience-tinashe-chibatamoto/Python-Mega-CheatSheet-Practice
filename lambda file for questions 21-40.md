Ans: The purpose of the ```enumerate()``` function in Python is to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) while keeping track of both the index and the value of each item in the sequence.
* It returns an iterator that produces pairs of index and value during each iteration, making it useful for tasks where you need to access both the position and the value of each item in the sequence<br>
Code Example:
```python
# Without enumerate

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Iterate over the list of fruits
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# Now with enumerate: Iterate over the list of fruits with indices
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
# Output:
# 0: apple
# 1: banana
# 2: cherry

# See, it provides the index and the value in each iteration
# Index: 0, Value: apple
# Index: 1, Value: banana
# Index: 2, Value: cherry
```

* The enumerate() function can also take an optional start parameter to specify the starting index (default is 0):<br>
Code Example:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
# Output:
# 1: apple
# 2: banana
# 3: cherry
```
* The ```enumerate()``` function is particularly useful when you need to access both the index and the value of elements in an iterable, such as when you're working with a list of items and need to display their positions or use the indices for some other purpose.
