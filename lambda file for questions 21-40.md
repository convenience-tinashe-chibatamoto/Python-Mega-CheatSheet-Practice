66. How do you check if a string contains a substring in Python?<br>
Ans: There are three main ways to check if a substring exists within a string in Python:<br>

Using the ```in``` operator:
* This is the simplest and most efficient way to check for a substring.
* The ```in``` operator returns ```True``` if the substring is found within the string, and ```False``` otherwise.<br>
Code Example:

```python
my_string = "This is a string"
substring = "is"

if substring in my_string:
  print("Substring found!")
else:
  print("Substring not found.")

# Output: Substring found!

# Another Example

string = "Hello, world!"
if "world" in string:
    print("Substring found")
else:
    print("Substring not found")

# Output: Substring found
```

Using the ```find()``` method:

```python
my_string = "This is a string"
substring = "is"

index = my_string.find(substring)

if index != -1:
  print("Substring found at index", index)
else:
  print("Substring not found.")

# Output: Substring found at index 2


# Another Example:

string = "Hello, world!"
if string.find("world") != -1:
    print("Substring found")
else:
    print("Substring not found")

# Output: Substring found
```

Using regular expressions (case-insensitive):

```python
import re

my_string = "This is a String"
substring = "is"

matches = re.findall(substring, my_string, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

if matches:
  print("Substring found:", matches)
else:
  print("Substring not found.")

# Output: Substring found: ['is', 'IS']
```

* All three methods achieve the goal.
* The ```in``` operator simply confirms its presence, while ```find()``` provides the starting index, and regular expressions with the ```re.IGNORECASE``` flag identify all occurrences regardless of case.
