26. What is the purpose of *args and **kwargs in Python function definitions?<br>
Ans: The ```*args``` and ```**kwargs``` are special syntaxes used in Python function definitions to handle a variable number of arguments. They provide flexibility to your functions in how they receive input.
* The purpose of ```*args``` and ```**kwargs``` in Python function definitions is to allow for a variable number of arguments to be passed to the function.<br><br>
 ```*args``` (arbitrary positional arguments):
* This is useful when you don't know in advance how many arguments the function will need to accept.
* The arguments are collected into a tuple, which can then be iterated over or accessed by index within the function..<br><br>
Code Example:
```python
def print_numbers(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

print_numbers(1, 2, 3)  # Output: 1 2 3
print_numbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8)  # Output: 4 5 6 7 8
```

```**kwargs``` (arbitrary keyword arguments):
* Used when you want to accept a varying number of keyword arguments.
* The arguments are collected into a dictionary, where the keys are the argument names, and the values are the corresponding argument values.
* This is useful when you want to provide the function with additional options or configuration settings.<br>
Code example:
```python
def print_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="Alice", age=30, city="New York")
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 30
# city: New York
```
* It's important to note that *args and **kwargs can be used together in a function definition, with *args collecting the positional arguments and **kwargs collecting the keyword arguments.<br>

27. What is the difference between instance, class, and static methods in Python?<br>
Ans: In Python, there are three main types of methods: instance methods, class methods, and static methods. The key differences between them are:<br><br>
Instance Methods:
* Instance methods are defined within a class and take the instance (```self```) as the first argument.
* They can access and modify the instance's attributes (the object's state).
* They are typically used to define the behavior of an object.<br>
Code Example:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")
```
Class Methods:
* Class methods are defined within a class and take the class (```cls```) as the first argument.
* They can access and modify the class's attributes, but they cannot access the instance's attributes directly.
* They are typically used for operations that are related to the class itself, rather than a specific instance.<br>
Code Example:
```python
class Person:
    population = 0

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        Person.population += 1

    @classmethod
    def get_population(cls):
        return cls.population
```
Static Methods:
* Static methods are defined within a class but do not take the instance (self) or the class (cls) as the first argument.
* They are essentially functions that are logically related to the class, but do not need to access the class or instance attributes.
* They are used when you want to group utility functions within a class, without the need to access the class or instance state.<br>
Code Example:
```python
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @staticmethod
    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b
```
The main differences are:
* Instance methods can access and modify the instance's attributes, while class methods and static methods cannot.
* Class methods can access and modify the class's attributes, while instance methods and static methods cannot.
* Static methods are independent of the class and instance, and they are used for utility functions that don't need to access the class or instance state.


28. How do you create simple program that calculates someone’s age using datetime module?
Ans:
```python
from datetime import date

def calculate_age(birth_year, birth_month, birth_day):
    today = date.today()
    birth_date = date(birth_year, birth_month, birth_day)
    age = today.year - birth_date.year
    
    # Adjust age if the birthday has not happened yet this year
    if today.month < birth_date.month or (today.month == birth_date.month and today.day < birth_date.day):
        age -= 1
    
    return age

# Example usage
birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))
birth_month = int(input("Enter your birth month: "))
birth_day = int(input("Enter your birth day: "))

age = calculate_age(birth_year, birth_month, birth_day)
print(f"Your age is: {age}")
```
* The program imports the ```date``` class from the ```datetime``` module.
* The ```calculate_age``` function takes three arguments: ```birth_year```, ```birth_month```, and ```birth_day```, which represent the user's date of birth.
* Inside the function, the ```date.today()``` method is used to get the current date.
* The ```date``` class is used to create a ```birth_date``` object using the provided birth year, month, and day.
* The age is calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year.
* However, if the current month is less than the birth month, or if the current month is the same as the birth month but the current day is less than the birth day, the age is decremented by 1 to account for the fact that the user's birthday has not happened yet this year.
* The calculated age is returned by the function.
* In the example usage, the user is prompted to enter their birth year, month, and day, and the calculate_age function is called with these values. The resulting age is then printed to the console.
* Remember to always use ```try```-```except``` when capturing user input or whenever there is user input.

29. Explain the concept of inheritance in Python.<br>
Ans: nheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class to be based on an existing class.
*  It facilitates code reusability and promotes code organization.
*  The new classes are called subclasses and the existing classes are called superclasses.
*  The new class inherits the attributes (variables) and methods from the existing class, and can also add new attributes and methods or modify the inherited ones.
*  In Python, inheritance is achieved using the following syntax:
 ```python
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # class body

# Which is the same as:

class Subclass(Superclass):
    # Subclass definition

class NewClass(OldClass):
    pass
```
