Ans: You can round a floating-point number to a specified number of decimal places in Python using the built-in ```round()``` function. This function takes two arguments:
* The number to be rounded
* (Optional) The number of decimal places to round to (defaults to 0, rounding to the nearest integer)
* If the optional argument is omitted, the number is rounded to the nearest integer.<br>
Code Example:

```python
number = 3.141592653589793
rounded_number = round(number, 2)
print(rounded_number)  # Output: 3.14


# Example 2
# Round to 2 decimal places
print(round(3.14159, 2))  # Output: 3.14

# Round to 1 decimal place
print(round(2.718, 1))  # Output: 2.7

# Round to the nearest integer
print(round(4.6))  # Output: 5
print(round(4.4))  # Output: 4

# Note that: The round() function uses banker's rounding, which means that if the digit in the discarded decimal place is 5, it rounds up if the next digit is even and down if it's odd
```
* This first code example rounds the number ```3.141592653589793``` to 2 decimal places, resulting in ```3.14```.
* For more control over rounding behavior (e.g., rounding up or down always), you can explore the ```math``` module functions like ```ceil()``` and ```floor()```.<br>
Code Example:

```python
import math

number = 3.14159

# Rounding up using ceil()
rounded_up = math.ceil(number)
print(f"Rounding {number} up with ceil(): {rounded_up}")  # Output: Rounding 3.14159 up with ceil(): 4

# Rounding down using floor()
rounded_down = math.floor(number)
print(f"Rounding {number} down with floor(): {rounded_down}")  # Output: Rounding 3.14159 down with floor(): 3

# Rounding to nearest using round() (default behavior)
rounded_nearest = round(number)
print(f"Rounding {number} to nearest with round(): {rounded_nearest}")  # Output: Rounding 3.14159 to nearest with round(): 3

# Trunc
print("Trunc:", math.trunc(number))    # Output: 3

```
* ```math.ceil(number)```: This function returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the given ```number```. In this case, ```math.ceil(3.14159)``` returns ```4```.
* ```math.floor(number)```: This function returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to the given ```number```. In this case, ```math.floor(3.14159)``` returns ```3```.
* ```math.trunc(number)```: This function returns the integral part of the ```number```, discarding any fractional digits. In this case, ```math.trunc(3.14159)``` returns ```3```.
* ```round(number)``` (always used without the ```math``` module) uses banker's rounding to round the number to the nearest integer. Here, it also rounds to ```3```.
* Although ```round()``` provides control over decimal places, it's for rounding to nearest integer by default. The ```ceil()``` and ```floor()``` functions from the ```math``` module offer a way to strictly round up or down to the nearest whole number.
