66. How do you check if a string contains a substring in Python?<br>
Ans: There are three main ways to check if a substring exists within a string in Python:<br>

Using the ```in``` operator:
* This is the simplest and most efficient way to check for a substring.
* The ```in``` operator returns ```True``` if the substring is found within the string, and ```False``` otherwise.<br>
Code Example:

```python
my_string = "This is a string"
substring = "is"

if substring in my_string:
  print("Substring found!")
else:
  print("Substring not found.")

# Output: Substring found!

# Another Example

string = "Hello, world!"
if "world" in string:
    print("Substring found")
else:
    print("Substring not found")

# Output: Substring found
```

Using the ```find()``` method:

```python
my_string = "This is a string"
substring = "is"

index = my_string.find(substring)

if index != -1:
  print("Substring found at index", index)
else:
  print("Substring not found.")

# Output: Substring found at index 2


# Another Example:

string = "Hello, world!"
if string.find("world") != -1:
    print("Substring found")
else:
    print("Substring not found")

# Output: Substring found
```

Using regular expressions (case-insensitive):

```python
import re

my_string = "This is a String"
substring = "is"

matches = re.findall(substring, my_string, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

if matches:
  print("Substring found:", matches)
else:
  print("Substring not found.")

# Output: Substring found: ['is', 'IS']
```

* All three methods achieve the goal.
* The ```in``` operator simply confirms its presence, while ```find()``` provides the starting index, and regular expressions with the ```re.IGNORECASE``` flag identify all occurrences regardless of case.

67. Explain the use of the assert statement in Python.<br>
Ans: In Python, the ```assert``` statement is a debugging and validation tool used to check through assumptions about conditions during development.
* If the condition is true, the ```assert``` statement does nothing, but if the condition is false, the ```assert``` statement raises an ```AssertionError``` exception.
* The general syntax for the assert statement is: ```assert condition, message```. The message is optional.<br>
Code Example:

```python
def is_positive(number):
  assert number > 0, "Number must be positive"
  # Rest of the function's logic

# Example usage with valid input
is_positive(5)  # No error, program continues

# Example usage with invalid input (causes assertion error)
is_positive(-2)  # Raises AssertionError with the message "Number must be positive"

# Example 2

# Checking a condition
x = 10
assert x > 0, "x must be a positive number"

# Checking a function's precondition
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Divisor cannot be zero"
    return a / b

divide(10, 0)  # Raises AssertionError: Divisor cannot be zero

# Checking a function's postcondition
def square(x):
    result = x * x
    assert result >= 0, "Result must be non-negative"
    return result

square(-5)  # Raises AssertionError: Result must be non-negative
```

*It's important to note that ```assert``` statements are not a replacement for proper error handling, but rather a tool for catching and debugging issues during development. In production code, it's generally better to use explicit exception handling or other error-handling mechanisms.
* Assertions are meant for development and debugging, not for production code. In production environments, assertions can slow down the program's execution. You can disable them using techniques like ```-O``` optimization flag during compilation.

68. How do you create an empty list, tuple, or dictionary in Python?<br>
Ans: The simplest way is to directly use the general syntax, ```[]``` for lists, ```{}``` for dictionaries, and ```()``` for tuples, with each being empty. Like this:<br>
Code Example:

```python
empty_list = []
print(empty_list)  # Output: []

empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)  # Output: ()

empty_dict = {}
print(empty_dict)  # Output: {}
```

* Let's start with one that is already populated, have one that is empty and make that populated:<br>
Code Example:

```python
populated_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
empty_list = []
empty_list.extend(populated_list)  # or empty_list = populated_list[:]
print(empty_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


populated_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
empty_tuple = ()
empty_tuple = tuple(populated_tuple)
print(empty_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)


populated_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
empty_dict = {}
empty_dict.update(populated_dict)
print(empty_dict)  # Output: {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

```
* Alternatively, you can also create an empty list, tuple, or dictionary directly without starting with a populated version like in the first example.

69. What is the purpose of the sum() function in Python?<br>
Ans: The ```sum()``` function in Python is a built-in function that efficiently calculates the sum of elements from an iterable object (such as a list, tuple, or set).
* It takes an iterable as its argument and returns the sum of all the elements in that iterable.
* The general syntax for using the ``` sum()``` function is:

```python
sum(iterable, start=0)

# start is an optional parameter that represents the initial value of the sum. If the start parameter is not provided, it defaults to 0.
```
<br>

Code Example:

```python
# Summing a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)  # Output: 15

# Summing a tuple of numbers
numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40)
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)  # Output: 100

# Summing a set of numbers
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)  # Output: 15

# Summing a list with a starting value
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
total = sum(numbers, 50)
print(total)  # Output: 150
```

* The ```sum()``` function is particularly useful when you need to calculate the total or cumulative sum of a sequence of numbers. It can also be used with custom data types that support the ```+``` operator, as long as the elements in the iterable are of the same type. For example, ```sum("123")``` would return ```123```.
* It's worth noting that the ```sum()``` function can also be used with iterables that contain non-numeric values, but in such cases, the ```+``` operator must be defined for the data type of the elements in the iterable.
