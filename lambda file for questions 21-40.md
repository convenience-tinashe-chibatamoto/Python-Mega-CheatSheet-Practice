Ans: In Python, you can sort a dictionary by its values using the ```sorted()``` function alongside a ```lambda``` function to define the sorting criteria.
* The ```sorted()``` function takes an iterable (in this case, the items() method of the dictionary) and returns a sorted list of tuples.
* If you want to get the sorted dictionary back, you can convert the sorted list of tuples back into a dictionary using the ```dict()``` function. <br>
Code Example:
```python
# Example dictionary
my_dict = {'apple': 2, 'banana': 1, 'cherry': 3}

# Sort the dictionary by values
sorted_dict = sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

# Print the sorted dictionary
print(sorted_dict)

# Output

# [('banana', 1), ('apple', 2), ('cherry', 3)]

# Converting the sorted list of tuples back into a dictionary using the dict() function:

sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))
print(sorted_dict)

# Output

# {'banana': 1, 'apple': 2, 'cherry': 3}
```
You can also sort the dictionary in reverse order (i.e. descending order) by adding the ```reverse=True``` parameter as the third parameter to the sorted() function:<br>
Code Example:
```python
sorted_dict = sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
print(sorted_dict)

# Output

# [('cherry', 3), ('apple', 2), ('banana', 1)]
```
<br>

56. Explain the purpose of the with statement in Python.<br>
Ans: The ```with``` statement in Python is a context manager used for resource management.
* It ensures that resources are properly acquired and released in a specific order, even in the presence of exceptions.
* This helps prevent resource leaks and makes your code cleaner, secure and more readable.<br>
Code Example: File I/O
```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

Example 2: Database Operations
```python
with sqlite3.connect('db.db') as connection:
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table")

```
* Without the ```with``` statement, you would have to explicitly call the ```close()``` method on the file object to ensure that it is properly closed.
* The ```with``` statement makes the code more concise and easier to read, and it also helps prevent common mistakes, such as forgetting to close the file or failing to handle exceptions properly.

57. How do you check if a key exists in a dictionary in Python?<br>
Ans: There are several ways to check if a key exists in a dictionary, but here's my favourite two:

Using ```in``` <br>
* This is the simplest and most straightforward way to check for key existence.
* The ```in``` operator returns ```True``` if the key is present in the dictionary, and ```False``` otherwise.<br>
Code Example:
```python
my_dict = {'apple': 2, 'banana': 1, 'cherry': 3}

if 'apple' in my_dict:
    print("The key 'apple' exists in the dictionary.")
else:
    print("The key 'apple' does not exist in the dictionary.")

# Output

# The key 'apple' exists in the dictionary.
```
Using the ```get()``` method:
* The ```get()``` method returns the value associated with the key if the key is present in the dictionary, or ```None``` if the key is not present. You can also provide a default value to be returned if the key is not found.
* It takes two arguments: The key to be checked, and an optional default value to return if the key is not found.<br>
Code Example:
```python
my_dict = {'apple': 2, 'banana': 1, 'cherry': 3}

if my_dict.get('apple') is not None:
    print("The key 'apple' exists in the dictionary.")
else:
    print("The key 'apple' does not exist in the dictionary.")

#  You can also provide a default value to be returned if the key is not found:

value = my_dict.get('pear', 0)
print(value)  # Output: 0 (since 'pear' is not a key in the dictionary)
```
