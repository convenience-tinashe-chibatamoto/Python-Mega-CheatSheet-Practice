Ans: There are several ways to remove duplicates from a list in Python.
* You can use sets, list comprehensions or for-loops.<br>
Using a set:
* This method converts the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates, and then converts the set back to a list.<br>
Code Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
unique_list = list(set(my_list))
print(unique_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Using a List Comprehension:
* This method uses a list comprehension to create a new list with unique elements.<br>
Code Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
unique_list = list(set([x for x in my_list]))
print(unique_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
Using a Loop and a Set:
* This method uses a loop to iterate through the list, adding unique elements to a new list while keeping track of the elements seen so far in a set.<br>
Code Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5]
unique_list = []
seen = set()
for item in my_list:
    if item not in seen:
        seen.add(item)
        unique_list.append(item)
print(unique_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
* The choice of method depends on your specific use case and personal preference. The set-based methods (1 and 2) are generally more concise and efficient, while the loop-based method (3) can be more flexible if you need to perform additional processing on the unique elements.
* For large lists, set-based approaches are generally faster and more efficient than loop-based methods.
